Read 'Em and Weep (or Drink)

"Life's a gamble. The drink? That's a guarantee. Now pick a card or get out."

♠️ The House Rules (About)

Welcome to Husk's Jackpot Bar. You want a fancy explanation? Fine. It's a digital menu for the hotel's booze supply.

We got a full house of recipes here. You can toggle the switch to play it safe with Mocktails (if you're trying to redeem your soul or whatever), or go all in with the Real Stuff (Alcoholic) if you just want to numb the pain of eternal damnation.

🎲 The Features

High Stakes Toggle: Flip the switch. One side is the "Sinner's Pot" (Alcohol), the other is the "Redemption Hand" (Mocktails).

Mobile Ready: Works on your phone so you can order while you're losing money at the poker table.

Full Deck: Recipes for every freak in the hotel.

Cheater's Guide: Includes "prop-safe" versions for you cosplayers who want to look the part without the hangover.

🥃 The Spread

Here's the deal. Don't ask for a reshuffle.

The Player

The Drink

The Bluff (Flavor)

Husk (The House)

Blackberry Bramble

Gin & Blackberries. Dark and bitter, like me.

Dirty Shirley Temple

Angel Dust

Frozen Sex on the Beach

Peach Slushie. Too much pink, too much noise.

Charlie

Strawberry Coconut Daiquiri

Sweet stuff. Tastes like unearned optimism.

Vaggie

Purple Rain

Sour Citrus. Sharp edges.

Sir Pentious

Cobra's Fang

Rum & Passion Fruit. Tries too hard.

Niffty

Old Fashioned

Bourbon. Small glass, big kick.

Lucifer

Candy Apple Cosmo

Apple & Chocolate. King of the castle.

Velvette

Red Velvet Martini

Chocolate Cream. Trendy garbage.

Vox

Shark Bite

Valentino
