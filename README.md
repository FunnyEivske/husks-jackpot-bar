## ♠️ The House Rules (About)

Welcome to **Husk's Jackpot Bar**. You want a fancy explanation? Fine. It's a digital menu for the hotel's booze supply.

We got a full house of recipes here. You can toggle the switch to play it safe with **Mocktails** (if you're trying to redeem your soul or whatever), or go all in with the **Real Stuff** (Alcoholic) if you just want to numb the pain of eternal damnation.

### 🎲 The Features

* **High Stakes Toggle:** Flip the switch. One side is the **"Sinner's Pot"** (Alcohol), the other is the **"Redemption Hand"** (Mocktails).
* **Mobile Ready:** Works on your phone so you can order while you're losing money at the poker table.
* **Full Deck:** Recipes for every freak in the hotel.
* **Cheater's Guide:** Includes "prop-safe" versions for you cosplayers who want to look the part without the hangover.

<b>Dirty Shirley Temple</b><br>
Cherry & Lime. Smells like trouble.
</p>

<p>
<b>Angel Dust</b><br>

</p>

<p>
<b>Charlie</b><br>

Sweet stuff. Tastes like unearned optimism.
</p>

## 🎭 For the High Rollers (Cosplay)

Since I know you lot like to dress up:
